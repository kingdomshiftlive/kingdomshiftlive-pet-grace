            <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
            <p>
              Some links on this website are affiliate links. This means that when you click on the link

              We only recommend products, books, and services that we personally use, have researched 
              thoroughly, or genuinely believe will benefit you on your pet care journey. Our editorial 
              opinions are never influenced by affiliate relationships. We would never recommend something 
              just for a commission.
            </p>
